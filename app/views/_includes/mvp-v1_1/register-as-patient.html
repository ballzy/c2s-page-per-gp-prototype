<h2>Register as a patient</h2>
<p>You need to go to the surgery to register. Take with you: </p>

<ul>
    <li>proof of identity (for example your passport)</li>
    <li>proof of your current address (for example a gas or electricity bill)</li>
    <li>your last GP surgery’s name and address </li>
    <li>your NHS number (you can find this on any document you’ve received from the NHS)</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll also need to fill in a registration form. You can <a href="#">download and fill in a form before going to the surgery</a>. But the receptionist might have other forms that you need to fill in.</p>

<p>After you’ve filled in the form, take it to reception at the surgery you want to join. The surgery might ask you to fill in other forms as part of the registration process.</p>
